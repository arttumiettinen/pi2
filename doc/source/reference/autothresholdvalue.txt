autothresholdvalue
******************


**Syntax:** :code:`autothresholdvalue(input image, output image, method, argument 1, argument 2, argument 3, argument 4)`

Calculates threshold value for the input image, according to a selected thresholding method, and places it into the output image. The supported thresholding methods are

**Otsu**

Otsu's thresholding algorithm.

The threshold value is calculated from the histogram of the image. The first and the second arguments are values corresponding to the minimum and maximum of the histogram. Out-of-range values will be placed to the first and the last bins, respectively. The third argument is the count of bins in the histogram.

Described in N. Otsu, A Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 9(1), 1979.

Original C++ code by Jordan Bevik, ported to ImageJ plugin by Gabriel Landini, and finally ported to pi2.


**Huang**

Huang's fuzzy thresholding method.

Uses Shannon's entropy function (one can also use Yager's entropy function).

The threshold value is calculated from the histogram of the image. The first and the second arguments are values corresponding to the minimum and maximum of the histogram. Out-of-range values will be placed to the first and the last bins, respectively. The third argument is the count of bins in the histogram.

**Intermodes**

Assumes a bimodal histogram. The histogram needs is iteratively smoothed using a running average of size 3 until there are only two local maxima at j and k. The threshold t is (j+k)/2.

Images with histograms having extremely unequal peaks or a broad and flat valleys are unsuitable for this method.

**IsoData**

Iterative procedure based on the isodata algorithm described in T.W. Ridler and S. Calvard, Picture thresholding using an iterative selection method, IEEE Transactions on System, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-8, 1978.

The procedure divides the image into objects and background by taking an initial threshold, then the averages of the pixels at or below the threshold and pixels above are computed. The averages of those two values are computed, the threshold is incremented and the process is repeated until the threshold is larger than the composite average. That is, threshold = (average background + average objects) / 2

The threshold value is calculated from the histogram of the image. The first and the second arguments are values corresponding to the minimum and maximum of the histogram. Out-of-range values will be placed to the first and the last bins, respectively. The third argument is the count of bins in the histogram.

The code implementing this method is probably originally from NIH Image, then ported to ImageJ, and then to pi2.

**Bernsen**

Finds Bernsen's thresholding method.

This method is mostly suited for local thresholding.

The method uses a user-provided contrast threshold. If the local contrast (max - min) is above or equal to the contrast threshold, the threshold is set at the local midgrey value (the mean of the minimum and maximum grey values in the local window (or whole image in the case of global thresholding)). If the local contrast is below the contrast threshold the neighbourhood is considered to consist only of one class and the pixel is set to object or background depending on the value of the midgrey.

The first argument is the local contrast threshold.

Described in J. Bernsen, Dynamic Thresholding of Grey-Level Images, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 1986.

The original code is written by Gabriel Landini, and it has been ported to pi2.
