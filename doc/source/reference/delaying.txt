.. _delaying:

delaying
********


**Syntax:** :code:`delaying(enable)`

Enables or disables possibility for combination of similar commands before sending them to compute processes/nodes in distributed processing (kind of lazy evaluation). Delaying decreases amount of disk space and I/O used for temporary images. When delaying is enabled, command run times (see echo command) are not accurate. Delaying is enabled by default.

This command can be used in the distributed processing mode, but it does not participate in distributed processing.
